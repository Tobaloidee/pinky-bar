FreeBSD support (mostly done):
* ported most of the net functions
* the alsa sound func is ok, and mpd was not tested yet
* The cpu clock speed mitigates the 133 ticks in FreeBSD with hard-coded 100 ticks macro
* the cores_load, overall cpu load, cpu_temp and the assembly get_cpu_info are ok
* in order cpu_temp to work, appropriate module have to be loaded, which limits the user choice down to intel core series and amd
* ported get_ram, get_packs, get_loadavg, get_uptime
* get_time, set_status, get_kernel, get_ssd work out-of-da-box

The following information contains weir values:

* motherboard info # smbus access denied (lower the security policy ?)
* voltage info # always negative values
* fans info # unreal 10k ~ 60k RPM values

Not sure about:
* disk io
* laptop battery support
